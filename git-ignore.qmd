title: "The `.gitignore`"
---

## Module Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- <u>Create</u> a `.gitignore` in a repository using a GitHub template
- <u>Explain</u> the purpose of a `.gitignore` in collaborative projects
- <u>Evaluate</u> the content you think might warrant adding to the `.gitignore`

## Overview

A `gitignore` is a file you can use to tell Git what _not_ to track. **Any file/folder whose name is in the `.gitignore` will not be tracked by Git.** This is useful if you want to include data in your local version of your repository but don't want to risk sharing that data by committing it to a public GitHub repository. This file exists at the top level of every repository and can be customized however is most useful to you and your collaborators.

## Creating a `.gitignore`

When you first create a repository you will have the opportunity to select a template `.gitignore` based on the coding language you plan on using. During the process of creating a repository, you can choose one of the templates curated by GitHub for a variety of coding languages. These templates exclude some typical machine-readable files that--while necessary for standard IDEs/background tasks--are not meaningful to track with version control.

To add a `.gitignore` during the repository creation phase, simply **click the dropdown menu and start typing the name of your coding language.** Unfortunately for R users, typing just "R" returns all templates that _contain_ the letter 'r' so you will need to scroll a bit to find the option that is actually for the R language. **Once you find the template you want, click it** and the template dropdown should change from ".gitignore template: None" to ".gitignore template: \<your pick\>".

If you create a repository without choosing a `.gitignore` template, don't worry: you can always create one later! If you want to create a `.gitignore` in an extant repository that lacks one, run the relevant command line code for your computer's operating system in your IDE's {{<fa terminal >}} "Terminal" pane.

:::{.panel-tabset}
#### {{< fa brands apple >}} Mac / {{< fa brands linux >}} Linux

```
touch .gitignore
```

#### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

```
copy NUL .gitignore
```

If `copy NUL` does not work, try `touch` instead.

## Using a `.gitignore`

A classic use-case for a `.gitignore`--as previously mentioned--is to ignore any data files that you have in your working directory but that you don't want Git to track of GitHub to store. In general, **script inputs and outputs _should not_ be tracked by Git or put in GitHub.** Versioning of tabular data doesn't really work very well and it'll clutter your GitHub repository with data files that you already have access to elsewhere.

Additionally, storing script inputs/outputs both on GitHub and elsewhere (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) undermines the "single source of truth" and dramatically increases the risk that you accidentally work with a superseded input file and get incorrect results.

Taken together, **the following demonstration of how to use a `.gitignore` will focus on ignoring a new data file in the working directory.** This file is informatively named "data.csv".

::::{.panel-tabset}
### In RStudio

To begin, we can **check the Git pane of RStudio to confirm that Git does see "data.csv"** even though Git is not tracking it currently.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/ignore/rstudio-01_untracked-csv.png" alt="Screen capture of RStudio where the Git pane shows an untracked file named 'data.csv'" width="100%"/>
</p>

With that confirmed, **click over to the "Files" pane.** Because the `.gitignore` file starts with a period, it is likely invisible to your standard file explorer program but RStudio's "Files" pane does see it and easily lets you interact with it.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/ignore/rstudio-02_files.png" alt="Screen capture of RStudio with the 'Files' pane open" width="100%"/>
</p>

In the "Files" pane, **click the `.gitignore` to open it**. If you scroll through you can see that the template from GitHub includes a number of files, many of which you may never have seen (again, often because they start with a period and are thus not easily visible).

<p align="center">
<img src="images/ignore/rstudio-03_ignore-open.png" alt="Screen capture of RStudio with the R template '.gitignore' from GitHub open" width="100%"/>
</p>

While currently we only have "data.csv" in our working directory, we can safely assume that we don't want _any_ CSVs to be tracked by Git. So, rather than entering "data.csv" into the `.gitignore`, let's **add a wildcard for _all_ CSVs by entering "\*.csv" at the bottom of the `gitignore`.** Note that in the below screen shot, we haven't saved our edits to the `.gitignore` so the "Git" pane still (1) shows "data.csv" and (2) _does not_ show any modifications to the `.gitignore`.

:::{.callout-note}
#### Comments in the `.gitignore`

You can enter comments in the `.gitignore` in the same way you would in R/Python code: by adding a `#` to the start of the line. This can be helpful if you want to add small documentation of what is being ignored or why it is being ignored.

</p>

Once you **save the edits to the `.gitignore`**, you'll notice that the Git pane automatically updates to (1) no longer show "data.csv" and (2) show that the `.gitignore` has been modified since the last commit. You can then **commit and push your edits to the `.gitignore` in the same way you would edits to any other file.**

### In Positron

To begin, we can **check the "source control" pane of Positron to confirm that Git does see "data.csv"** even though Git is not tracking it currently.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/ignore/positron-01_untracked-csv.png" alt="Screen capture of Positron where the source control pane shows an untracked file named 'data.csv'" width="50%"/>
</p>

With that confirmed, **click over to the "Explorer" pane.** Because the `.gitignore` file starts with a period, it is likely invisible to your standard file explorer program but Positron's "Explorer" pane does see it and easily lets you interact with it.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/ignore/positron-02_files.png" alt="Screen capture of Positron with the 'Explorer' pane open" width="50%"/>
</p>

In the "Explorer" pane, **click the `.gitignore` to open it**. If you scroll through you can see that the template from GitHub includes a number of files, many of which you may never have seen (again, often because they start with a period and are thus not easily visible).

<p align="center">

# BASEMENT






## Interacting with the `.gitignore`

Once you have the one, you can open the `.gitignore` by clicking it from the "Files" pane of RStudio.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/git_ignore/ignore-5-rstudio-files.png" alt="Screenshot of the 'files' pane in RStudio which includes the .Rproj file, the README, and the gitignore" width="65%"/>
</p>

After you click it you'll be looking at a file that looks very similar to any other file in RStudio.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/git_ignore/ignore-6-viewing.png" alt="Screenshot of the gitignore open in RStudio looking similar to any other file in RStudio" width="100%"/>
</p>

Now let's add something to it! As you can see from the Git pane of the above image (top right), after cloning our new repository, the only file Git is flagging as untracked is the .Rproj file created whenever you make a new RStudio project.

If we add `*.Rproj` to our `.gitignore`, the Git pane will show that the only change is that lines have been added to the `.gitignore`. The .Rproj file with the double yellow question marks next to it is gone!

<p align="center">
<img src="images/git_ignore/ignore-7-editing.png" alt="Screenshot of RStudio demonstrating that when a file name or extension is added to the gitignore and that change is saved then the file in question disappears from RStudio's Git pane" width="100%"/>
</p>

Once you've edited the `.gitignore` it is generally a good practice to push those changes as soon as possible. If you flag a certain file (or folder) to be ignored while someone else is depending on it, if you wait to push the change you can risk a serious conflict. Or, they might commit a file you want ignored which is frustrating to remove (see "Exceptions to the `.gitignore`" below).

<p align="center">
<img src="images/git_ignore/ignore-8-commit.png" alt="Screenshot of RStudio's commit window where the change to the gitignore is being committed" width="80%"/>
</p>

Only the commit is pictured above, but pushing & pulling works in the same way here as it does elsewhere.

## Our Recommendations

There are many different opinions on what should go into a `.gitignore` but we have a few suggestions that might prove helpful (or are at least worth considering).

1. **Use the GitHub `.gitignore` template for your chosen programming environment**

    - There are a lot of small files that typical users don't care about that your project will accumulate over its lifecycle. If you don't flag these in the `.gitignore` it can become difficult to sort through your repository

2. **Add `.DS_Store`**

    - Macs create a "Desktop Services Store" file (or ".DS_Store" for short) every time you open a folder. This file is invisible in your file manager but _can_ be committed. This file has no practical value in your project and a separate one exists in every subfolder so tracking them can quickly clutter a repository if you use subfolders

3. **Other Considerations**

    - Some people recommend adding <u>everything your script creates</u> to the `.gitignore`. The theory being that if someone wants to see those outputs, they would only need to run your script(s) in order to create their own versions
    - Another way of thinking about this is to create a dedicated folder to store products in (e.g., "data", "exports", etc.) and then add that folder to the `.gitignore`. This means you don't need to worry about adding specific files to the `.gitignore` so long as all the files live in a folder you've already designated as something for Git to not track

4. Do you have another idea for what you typically add to a `.gitignore`?

    - Please share it with us by [posting an Issue](https://github.com/lter/workshop-github/issues); we'd love to hear from you!

### Should You Ignore the .Rproj File?

If you are an RStudio user, you *could* choose to add the R project file to your `.gitignore`. <u>However</u>, this is a somewhat thorny decision with strong arguments on both sides. We'll try to summarize some of the big considerations below to help inform your decision.

#### Option A: **Commit** the .Rproj

There are (in our opinion) three strong arguments for committing the .Rproj:

1. Ease of Access

    - For non-R users, it can be really helpful to have just one file that they need to double click in order to open and interact with the whole R project. By committing the .Rproj, you make the post-clone start up instructions much simpler (i.e., "click the file ending in '.Rproj' and you're good to go")

2. Facilitate Cloning Outside of RStudio

    - While our workshop has exclusively covered cloning a repo through RStudio, it is absolutely possible to clone without using RStudio. If someone goes this route, and the .Rproj is not already included in the repo, they will be left without one. So, after the clone they would then have an extra step to create their own .Rproj if they wanted to use RStudio to interact with the code
    - Note that if everyone on your team is cloning via RStudio, this is not really an issue because cloning via RStudio *creates* a new .Rproj if one does not already exist

3. Enforce Project Settings

    - Fundamentally, the .Rproj is a list of settings that you're using for a specific project in RStudio. If you wanted to create some defaults of those settings for anyone who cloned your repository, you could commit your .Rproj with your preferred settings
    - That said, any member of your team who changed those settings would have the option to commit the corresponding change to the .Rproj file and the next time you **<span style="color:blue">pull</span>** you would have their settings instead

#### Option B: Ignore the .Rproj

We feel there are some serious reasons for ignoring the .Rproj as well:

1. Risk of Deletion

    - Say you decide to commit your .Rproj, what happens if someone deletes it and **<span style="color:green">pushes</span>** that deletion? This can happen if team members clone their version of the repo with a different name resulting in two local .Rproj files where one is redundant from that team member's perspective
    - If a .Rproj is committed and then subsequently deleted, everyone who **<span style="color:blue">pulls</span>** that change will delete their local project. This results in an instant error that can be difficult to recognize if you don't know beforehand about this risk. The only fix is for all affected users to re-clone the repository
    - So, if you add the .Rproj to the `.gitignore` preemptively, you can avoid the risk of this happening at some later stage; you could also add it as "`*.Rproj`" so regardless of the name of the file it will be ignored if the file type is .Rproj

2. Loss of Flexibility

    - When you commit your .Rproj you are "locking in" the name of your project. If your preliminary data exploration and analyses bring new hypotheses and goals to light you may want to change your project name to better match this new framing. If you had previously committed your .Rproj, it can be a hassle to change its name and **<span style="color:green">push</span>** this change
    - Alternatively, you may want to change your GitHub repository name after publication to share keywords with your final manuscript title or the journal name to make the repository more easily searchable by your readers. Technically you could change the GitHub repository name without changing the corresponding .Rproj filename but there will be some disonance there if your readers clone your code

3. Preserve Team Members' Local Filing Decisions

    - Most working group members are involved in a staggering variety of pursuits in addition to their role in a synthesis working group. People tend to have their own filing systems in their computers to help them quickly and easily navigate among their different projects
    - If you **commit** the .Rproj, you force everyone who clones your repository to use your naming convention which can be a hurdle (albeit likely a minor one) as they juggle their responsibilities

#### Decision

Ultimately, this is up to you and your team to decide! Hopefully our outlined reasons for and against adding the .Rproj to the `.gitignore` help inform this decision and we are happy to discuss this more if you have follow up questions!

## Ignoring Previously Tracked Content

Imagine a situation where you commit a data file to your GitHub repository and push that commit. Now your data file is tracked by Git and every time you alter that file RStudio's "Git" pane will notify you that the file changed by placing the blue "M" next to the file's name. Let's say that eventually you decide that you want to (1) remove the file from your GitHub repository and (2) stop Git from tracking *future* changes to the file. If this is the case, you'll need to do the following:

1. Either (A) delete the file or (B) move it out of the repository's folder

    - Either option will register as "deleting" the file from Git's perspective

2. **Commit** the deletion

3. **<span style="color:green">Push</span>** that change

4. Add the name of that file to your `.gitignore`

Once you've done these steps, even if you put the file back in your repository, Git won't track its addition or any changes to it over time.
