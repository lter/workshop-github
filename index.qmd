### Welcome!

<img src="images/logos/github.png" alt="Logo for GitHub" align="right" width="17%" />

This workshop provides an overview of what "version control" systems are and how they fit into collaborative coding within your team. Specifically, **we are focusing here on an introductory approach to version control that focuses on using GitHub either by itself or with Git via RStudio**. We are always happy to improve workshop content so please don't hesitate to [post an Issue](https://github.com/lter/workshop-github/issues) on our GitHub repository if you see clear areas for improvement!

## Workshop Preparation

To maximize the value of this workshop to you, **we recommend that you take the following steps before the day of the workshop**. You may have already completed some or all of these steps but please read through and confirm that you've done all of the steps that are relevant to you to ensure that all participants arrive with a common foundation of installed programs. If anything is unclear, feel free to reach out to us; our contact information can be found in the "SciComp Team" dropdown menu in the "People" page.

#### Institution-Owned Computers

If your institution has a dedicated IT team that has sole power to install software on your computer, you will need to contact them before the workshop to do the installation bits of the prep steps we outline below.
:::

There are a couple of distinct use-cases you might have for GitHub that will affect what preparation you need to do before this workshop. Consider the tabs below and follow all of the numbered steps in the choice that best fits your needs.

### GitHub By Itself

#### 1. Create a GitHub Account

{{< include prep-steps/create_github-acct.qmd >}}

#### 2. Celebrate!

{{< include prep-steps/celebrate.qmd >}}

### GitHub with RStudio

:::{.callout-note}
#### Running Code in Following Steps

The below preparation steps includes some code for making sure everything is installed as it should be. All code is either R code ({{< fa brands r-project >}}) or is command line code ({{< fa terminal >}}). **In either case, you'll run all provided code <u>in RStudio</u>**. {{< fa brands r-project >}} R code should be run in the "Console" tab of RStudio while {{< fa terminal >}} command line code should be run in the "Terminal" tab of RStudio.

<u>If you get errors with the provided code, _double check that you are running it in the right place</u>!_

## GitHub + Science Publications

The reproducibility and collaborative benefits of GitHub for working scientists is well appreciated and increasingly well published upon. See below for brief synopses of papers published in this realm that we think may resonate with your team's disciplinary backgrounds and motivations.

In the ecology and evolutionary biology sphere, Pereira Braga et al. published "[Not just for programmers: How GitHub can accelerate collaborative and reproducible research in ecology and evolution](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.14108)" in _Methods in Ecology & Evolution_. This paper is a phenomenal resource for ecologists and evolutionary biologists who are considering the value of GitHub to them in and outside of a working group context. The authors identify 12 uses of GitHub for the EEB community and arrange them by technical difficulty (ranging from beginner to advanced) and degree of collaboration (low to high). We have embedded this paper's second figure in this website below as it is a neat summarization of many of their central points. That said, we definitely recommend reading (and citing!) [Pereira Braga et al. 2023](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.14108) for more detail than we've included in this blurb.

If you are concerned about the technical side of GitHub for yourself and/or your lab group, we recommend focusing on the lower technical difficulty benefits of GitHub (see the **<span style="color:blue">blue</span>** bars). We also think that some of the intermediate technical difficulty uses (**<span style="color:orange">orange</span>** bars) may be relevant to working group priorities and goals.
