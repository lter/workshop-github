# LTER Scientific Computing Workshop - Collaborative Coding with GitHub

## Repository Explanation

In synthesis science, collaboration on code products is often integral to the productivity of the group. However, learning to use the software and graphical user interfaces that support this kind of teamwork can be a significant hurdle for teams that are already experts in their subject areas. This workshop is aimed at helping participants gain an understanding of the fundamental purpose and functioning of "version control"" systems–specifically GitHub–to help teams code collaboratively more effectively and confidently.
