Git users but hopefully this list helps to clarify:\n\nA fork creates a new repository while a branch exists within a given repository\nA fork is owned by a different user/organization than the original, a branch does not change repository ownership\nA fork’s “parent” repository is not recognized by Git but Git does ‘know’ which branch a given branch originates from.",

    "text": "Choosing Whether to Fork or to Branch\nA good rule of thumb for whether you should fork or branch a repository is based on whether you’re working independently from the owner of the repository versus collaborating actively with them.\nIf you are largely independent from the repository’s owner, fork that repository to get your own copy to independently work in. If you are actively collaborating, it is likely that you’ll want to work in a branch.\nIt is important to note that both forks and branches can be merged back into their source (the “main” branch for branches and the original repository for forks) via pull request so you need not worry that choosing one or the other will preclude integration with the source.",

From there, there is a convenient “Fork” button you can click that (after a screen very much like that of creating a new repository) creates a duplicate of the repository in your profile’s repository list.\nOnce the fork is created, you simply clone the repository as you would when beginning work with any other GitHub repository.\nFrom there on you work as your normally would with GitHub: edit, commit, pull, and push.\nWhile it is not shown in the below diagram, if needed you can submit a “pull request” (see Appendix B: Branches) to merge your version of the repository with the version you initially forked from. This is not a required part of the workflow which is why it is excluded from the diagram.\n\n\n\nNow we’ve covered the general operation of forking, let’s go over the specifics step-by-step.",

Note that in this case the repository we created to take these screen captures is very new but this need not be the case!\nIn the top right of the repository’s GitHub page there is a “Fork” button (between “Unwatch” and “Star”), click it to begin forking.\n\n\n\nThis redirects you to a page that is very similar to the page for creating a new repository de novo (see Chapter 3: Using GitHub).\nHere you can select who you want to own the repository from a dropdown including any organizations you are a member of and your username if you want to personally own the fork.\nYou can also change the repository name (though the default is to retain the same name) and add a description of your purpose for the fork.\nYou may notice that in this page you do not have the option to specify public versus private or any of the ‘initialize’ steps (e.g., README, gitignore, or licence). Forks will inherit these settings from the repository they are forked from so they do not need to specified here.\nOnce you are happy with the owner of the fork, the name, and the description, click the green “Create fork” button.\n\n\n\nDepending on the amount of content in the repository you are forking and your internet speed this may take anywhere from a few seconds to 1-2 minutes so you will need to wait for a moment while GitHub creates a new duplicate repository under the control of the owner you specified.\nAfter the process completes the page will refresh and you will find yourself on the landing page for your new forked repository!\n\n\n\nThis repository has a fork icon in the top left (to the left of the owner/repository name) and includes a link to the repository that it came from just beneath that.\nThe other salient difference is that between the branch and “Code” buttons and the list of files there is a bar that indicates whether the fork is up to date with the repository it was forked from.\nIf the “parent” repository is updated (i.e., someone pushes changes to it after you forked) you can click the “Fetch upstream” button to integrate those changes with your fork.\nIf you decide that your changes are a meaningful improvement that the parent repository could benefit from, you can click the “Contribute” button to begin the process of submitting a pull request to integrate your edits with the parent (see Appendix B: Branches for instructions on submitting a pull request).\nFrom here on you can work within your fork as you would within any other repository!

Markdown syntax is a simplified (relatively) way of formatting text that provides coarse control without getting bogged down in potentially unnecessary levels of detail. Markdown syntax is discussed extensively elsewhere and your README can be very valuable with just plain text in a .md file so we will avoid discussing it in detail here.\nThe main take away here is that “under the hood”, this package’s README landing page is generated from the formatting specified in this “raw” file.

    "text": "What is a Branch?\nA branch is essentially a working environment in your Git repository that is separate from your main working area. This can be incredibly useful when you have a task to work on but you don’t want to risk damaging the version of your code that already works. Note that “branch” can be either a noun or a verb as with many of the Git vocabulary words discussed earlier (e.g., “commit”, “push”, etc.).\nBranches are typically created with the intent to put the work in the branch back into the main branch when you are done with it. Implicit in that rationale is the fact that most branches are created with a specific task/sub-task in mind and known to be temporary from the outset.\nAs an example, imagine that you want to put a better engine in your car but you don’t want to risk damaging your car as you go about that job. In Git terms you could create a branch to work on those mechanical improvements while at the same time preserving your original car separately (in the “main” branch). When you’re done experimenting and happy with the new version of your car, you can merge the two cars keeping all of the improvements you made in your branch.\nEven if you think you’ve never worked with Git branches you actually have! All Git repositories actually start in a branch named “main” so even if you’ve never intentionally created a branch, you’ve been working in your “main” branch all along.",

    "text": "Brief Overview of Branch Workflow\nBefore diving into the specifics of how to use branches while working with Git, let’s take a look at a general overview of that process.\nAs with many other Git operations, the first thing to do is pull from GitHub to your local repository to ensure that you’re working with the most up-to-date version of everything in the repo (see Step 1 below).\nOnce that is done, you can create a branch on your local machine (automatically shifting your RStudio project into that new branch). Doing this on your machine also updates GitHub to show that there are multiple branches (see Step 2 below).\nOnce you have created a branch you can work in it locally (and via GitHub directly) as you would normally. You can edit your files locally, commit those changes, pull from GitHub (within the branch), and push to GitHub (see Steps 3-4 below).\nWhen you are done working with the branch (i.e., you’ve finished the task for which you created the branch), you can use GitHub to merge your branch with the main one (see Step 5 below). This puts all of the content in your branch into the main one now (which puts your local version of the “main” branch behind!).\nOnce the two branches are merged on GitHub, go back to your local computer, manually change the branch to the main branch and pull (see Step 7 below). This updates your local version of the main branch and avoids future problems.\nGiven that most branches are not used again after they are merged, it is often a good housekeeping step to then delete your branch on GitHub and locally once you have successfully merged the pull request (see Steps 6 & 8 below). Note that in the below diagram step 6 and 8 occur on either side of step 7 but in truth they can both come after depending on your preference.\nHowever, deletion of the branch either locally or via GitHub must come after step 5!\nAs you can see from the above text and the below diagram, branches have a few more moving parts than the Git and GitHub operations we’ve discussed so far. That said, they can be a powerful tool in service of collaborative work because you can have multiple branches active at the same all working on separate tasks. This approach can be an easy (or at least easier) workflow for working together while avoiding conflicts (again, see “Appendix A: Conflicts”).\n\n\n\nNow we’ve gone over this big picture overview, let’s walk step-by-step through creating, working in and ultimately merging branches!",

This is especially valuable if you are not the one reviewing pull requests as this can help someone quickly familiarize themselves with what you have done.\nOnce you’re satisfied with your title and message, click the green “Create pull request” button.\n\n\n\nThat done, GitHub will send you to a page that looks very much like a Github issue (see the chapter on issues). At the top is whatever title and message you just wrote when opening the pull request following by a list of all of the commits in that branch.\nThose commits are “live” and function as hyperlinks in case you want to view how your code is preserved in GitHub.\nNote also that if you realize you forgot to do something in your branch (or if someone asks you change something) you can return to RStudio and commit/pull/push and it will automatically update on the pull request. Pull requests are for merging a whole branch, not for merging just a part of the work in the branch.\nYou or your team can post messages on a pull request as needed (see the text box at the bottom of the below picture).\nIf you are ready to merge a pull request from your branch into the “main” branch click the intuitively-named green “Merge pull request” button.\n\n\n\nGitHub will open another text box where you can add a commit message to your acceptance of the pull request. If whoever opened the pull request was sufficiently detailed in their opening comment(s) this may not need to be terribly detailed but it can’t hurt!\nOnce your message is written, click the green “Confirm merge” button.\n\n\n\nThe green ‘open’ buttons will change to purple and will use the “merge” icon of two streams combining. As with GitHub issues you can continue to post comments on a merged pull request if you feel it will be valuable for posterity to do so.\nGitHub will also handily create a “Delete branch” button at the bottom of the pull request’s timeline. We recommend that you click it given that your branch’s purpose is served and having irrelevant branches clutters your GitHub and may even cause problems if you have two similarly-named branches where one has been merged and the other has not.\n\n\n\nAfter you click “Delete branch” it will be replaced by a “Restore branch” button so you could always reclaim it if need be.\n\n\n\nFinally, return to the “Code” tab of your GitHub repository and you can see that the changes we implemented in the branch are now part of the repository’s “main” branch.

    "text": "Workshop Preparation\nFor those of you with a dedicated IT team that has sole power to install software on your computer: you will need to contact them before the workshop to do the installation bits of the prep steps we outline below.\n\n1. Install R\nBegin by installing R. If you already have R, check that you have at least version 4.0.0 by running the following code:\n\nversion$version.string\n\nIf your version starts with a 3 (e.g., the above code returns “R version 3…”), please update R to make sure all packages behave as expected.\n\n\n2. Install RStudio\nOnce you have R (ver. ≥4.0), install RStudio. If you already have RStudio installed, you may want to make sure that you’re using a recent version to take advantage of some quality of life improvements that are broadly useful.\n\n\n3. Install Git\nWith R and RStudio installed you can now install Git! Git is the software that actually does the behind-the-scenes version control operations we’ll cover in this workshop. Jennifer Bryan’s “Happy Git and GitHub for the useR” digital book does a really nice job covering how to install Git for different computer operating systems (i.e., Mac vs. Windows vs. Linux).\nConsult Dr. Bryan’s Git installation instructions and be sure to follow the steps relevant for your operating system! If you are a Windows user, be sure to follow along with “Option 1” in the instructions linked above! That variant gives some under-the-hood tools we’ll implicitly rely on later.\n\n\n4. Check that Git was installed correctly\nTo check that Git was installed correctly, you can follow the Git already installed? section of Dr. Bryan’s book.\nIn a nutshell, if you’re a Mac user, find and open the Terminal. Then type which git to check that it exists at a valid location on your computer.\nIf you’re a Windows user, find and open Git Bash. Then type which git to check that it exists at a valid location on your computer.\nOnce you’ve installed Git successfully, RStudio should be able to detect it. Check if RStudio is able to detect it now by going to Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Git/SVN. If you see a file path under “Git executable” then you are good to go!\nIf you had your RStudio session open while you installed Git for the first time, RStudio may not have detected Git on your computer. In that case, please close and restart RStudio before checking again.\n\n\n5. Create a GitHub Account\nNow that you’re all done installing programs, it’s time to create an account on GitHub. GitHub is how you’ll be able to collaborate with others. Dr. Bryan has some nice guidelines for picking a good username and we also recommend adding a picture of yourself so that group members can more confidently identify one another on GitHub.\n\n\n6. Connect Git and GitHub\nThe last step to take before you’re all set for the workshop is to get these components talking to one another! You set a password for your GitHub which is used for logging in to GitHub but to actually put your code changes from your computer up to GitHub you’ll need to authenticate yourself. There are two paths for authentication:\n\nPersonal Access Token (PAT)\nSecure Shell (SSH)\n\nWhat’s the difference? Essentially, authenticating via token makes many things “just work” while authenticating via SSH will work for some things but in other contexts you would also need to do token-based authentication. For a more complete discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of each, see Dr. Bryan’s “HTTPS versus SSH” page.\nFollow the steps of your chosen authentication method in the tabs below.\n\nPersonal Access TokenSSH\n\n\n\n# Install the `usethis` and `gitcreds` packages\n#install.packages(c(\"usethis\", \"gitcreds\"))\nlibrary(usethis); library(gitcreds)\n\n# Add your GitHub username and email\nusethis::use_git_config(user.name = \"Jane Doe\",\n                        user.email = \"jane@example.org\")\n\n# Create a token (Note this will open a GitHub browser tab)\n## See steps 6-10 in GitHub's tutorial (link below)\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nCopy your token at the end of the above step. Once you leave the page where your token is displayed you’ll never get to see it again! So if you close that page without copying it you’ll need to make a new one in order to continue.\nOnce you’ve copied your token, run the code below to save your credentials in RStudio.\n\n# Now, give your token to RStudio\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n## After you run this line you'll follow some prompts in the \"Console\" tab of RStudio\n\nThis line of code will prompt you to paste your token in the “Console” tab. After you do so, your token will be safely stored in RStudio!\n\n\n\n\nFurther Information\nYou may also find GitHub’s PAT tutorial or the Happy Git with R PAT tutorial helpful.\n\n\n\nBegin by using the command line (a.k.a. “shell” or “Terminal”) to check whether you already have SSH keys created on your computer. If you get a message saying that nothing exists or the path doesn’t exist, you do not have SSH keys (yet).\n\nls -al ~/.ssh/\n\nIf you do need to create an SSH key pair you can do so via the command line. When you create a key pair you’ll need to include a descriptive comment to help ‘future you’ if you ever have multiple key pairs in your life. We recommend “lter” plus your GitHub username to keep things simple.\n\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"lter-github\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlder Computer?\n\n\n\nIf you get a warning/error because your system is too old to support the Ed25519 algorithm (that’s the variant recommended by GitHub) you can instead use:\n\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"lter-github\"\n\n\n\nAccept the prompt to save the key in the default location by hitting Enter. You will be prompted to enter a passphrase that will be required to access your SSH key later on. This step is technically optional but is considered a best practice. If SSH keys are totally new to you, we recommend skipping the passphrase step.\nOnce you’ve generated the key pair, follow GitHub’s instructions on adding that key pair to your computer’s ssh-agent (roughly equivalent to a password manager but just for SSH key pairs).\nFinally, you need to share the public key with your GitHub self. Once again we’ll refer you to the phenomenal materials generated by Dr. Bryan on this topic.\n\nFurther Information\nYou may also find GitHub’s SSH documentation or the Happy Git with R SSH tutorial helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Celebrate!\nAfter following all the previous preparation steps, your setup should now be complete.",

See below for brief synopses of papers published in this realm that we think may resonate with your team’s disciplinary backgrounds and motivations.\nIn the ecology and evolutionary biology sphere, Pereira Braga et al. published “Not just for programmers: How GitHub can accelerate collaborative and reproducible research in ecology and evolution” in Methods in Ecology & Evolution. This paper is a phenomenal resource for ecologists and evolutionary biologists who are considering the value of GitHub to them in and outside of a working group context. The authors identify 12 uses of GitHub for the EEB community and arrange them by technical difficulty (ranging from beginner to advanced) and degree of collaboration (low to high). We have embedded this paper’s second figure in this website below as it is a neat summarization of many of their central points. That said, we definitely recommend reading (and citing!) Pereira Braga et al. 2023 for more detail than we’ve included in this blurb.\nIf you are concerned about the technical side of GitHub for yourself and/or your lab group, we recommend focusing on the lower technical difficulty benefits of GitHub (see the blue bars). We also think that some of the intermediate technical difficulty uses (orange bars) may be relevant to working group priorities and goals.",

    "text": "How to Stand Out\nIf you act on the suggestions we’ve outlined above you will already be well on the way to fully leveraging GitHub as a professional portfolio. That said, there are always means of making yourself and your work stand out even more! Below is a non-exhaustive list of some ideas for continuing to improve your portfolio.\n\nCreate a Personal Website\nPersonal websites are a cool way to visually convey everything that goes into a portfolio–your background, work experiences, interests, accomplishments, projects, contact information, etc. With a website, you can be more creative and flexible in how you want to present yourself to others. Plus, non-GitHub users may be more inclined to navigate someone’s personal website rather than their GitHub profile. A further benefit of creating a personal website is that you will learn (and demonstrate!) a suite of additional skills that contribute to your portfolio in and of themselves.\nAlthough the topic of creating your own personal website is outside the scope of this workshop, there are tons of resources on how to get started. If you’re interested, check out the SciComp team’s tutorial on building a website with Quarto. Also feel free to check out Sam Csik’s tutorials on how to create and customize your website using Quarto.\nSince this will be a personal website deployed through GitHub Pages, remember to name your Quarto project and GitHub repo: &lt;YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME&gt;.github.io, replacing &lt;YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME&gt; with your actual username. You’re only allowed one user website with the github.io suffix. Follow the instructions in the linked tutorials to deploy the website via GitHub when you’re done! If all goes well, your website will be live at: https://&lt;YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME&gt;.github.io/\nIf you’re looking for some inspiration, check out Angel’s (angelchen7.github.io) and Nick’s websites (njlyon0.github.io)!\n\n\nTeam up with Peers\nWithin any career path some of the best people to get professional feedback from are your peers! Your colleagues have applied to the same types of positions that you have and often have crucial insight that can help you learn from both the successes and the pitfalls that they have encountered. In addition, they can a well-trained critical eye that can help you improve your portfolio in ways you may never have imagined by yourself.\nOnce you have a draft portfolio, share it with your peers, advisers, and mentors for feedback. Write down their suggestions and act on all of the ones that seem reasonable to you. If you’d like, repeat this process of iterative revision for as long as you feel that it is needed! It may also make sense to gather other peers without GitHub portfolios into a journal club-style group and meet regularly to develop and critique one another’s materials.",

    "text": "What is an Issue?\nIssues are a convenient way of identifying and delegating tasks within a repository as well as documenting progress over time. They can also be used as a digital ‘lab notebook’ for personal use to brainstorm on a novel topic or preserve important links or supplementary material for easy distribution across a whole team.\nImportantly, while issues can definitely be helpful they are not required to successfully use GitHub for collaborating as a team. Issues absolutely have the potential to facilitate division of labor within a team though and are thus worth covering in this training.\nAn additional function that may be outside of the scope of what you need to use within your team is that it allows non-members to flag issues that they’ve had with code written by your team or request additional functionality that doesn’t yet exist in your framework. Depending on your use of packages in R you may have already opened an issue on an existing R package to do just that!\nTo see a more complete example of how issues can be used we can examine the open issues of an established R package.\n\nIssues Example with the googledrive Package\nBelow is the GitHub landing page for the googldrive package and you can see that next to the underlined “Code” tab is an “Issues” tab with a gray circle with the number 22 in it. This number notifies us that as of this screen capture, there were twenty two open issues on this package’s GitHub repository. Note that your GitHub interface may be white but it will not change the position of buttons or tabs.\n\n\n\nIf you click over to the issues tab you will see the titles of all current “open” (i.e., ongoing) issues on the repository. Each issue has a title and beneath that a unique number following a # as well as how long ago the issue was opened and the GitHub username of the person who opened the issue. On the right side of each issue’s thumbnail you can see the number of comments added to it.\n\n\n\nComments can be used to have a full dialogue among different users – potentially both in and outside of the team responsible for managing the code! The conversational aspect of issues can make them functionally similar to an email thread or messaging app chain. This communication can help keep the solutions to tasks well-documented while ensuring that every member of your group can have their voice heard.",

    "text": "Creating your First Issue\nWhen you first visit the Issues tab of your repository it won’t include any open issues and will look like this.\n\n\n\nTo create an issue, click the green button and a new page will open that looks like the below.\n\n\n\nIn this page you can create a brief title (these are better if they are concise while still trying to convey the broader context for the task identified by the issue) and add a longer comment into the body of the issue. That longer comment can be as simple as a few bullet points of what the problem is or as complex as a markdown-formatted hyperlink-supported thesis on the task at hand.\nWhile issue comments are completely free for you to use as you see fit, it is important to remember that your most frequent collaborator is yourself in the future so a future version of yourself will absolutely thank you for including extra information when you first open an issue. In a team setting like this one, extra detail can also really help when the person opening the issue is not the person responsible for editing the code to address it.\nIn addition to the title and main body of the issue you can also see a sidebar on the right containing other options for adding detail to an issue. In particular, the “Assignees” and “Labels” sections can be useful in delegating a task to a specific person or naming the category that this task falls under respectively.\nReturning to our googledrive example for a moment, you can see that the package maintainers use multiple labels on some issues to help communicate across their team what processes are affected by or relevant to each particular issue.\n\n\n\nWhen you are creating your first issue however you won’t have any of those customized labels. However, GitHub does offer some pre-built template labels that may suit your needs and makes adding your own customized labels very approachable.\nTo see the current label options, click the “Labels” text or the gear to its right and either scroll and click the desired label(s) from the list or scroll to the bottom and click “Edit labels” to create new labels or modify the template labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice - Labels\n\n\n\nWhat are some labels that might be useful for your project to divide up issues? Can labels divide tasks related to analysis versus visualization of data? Or use them to further subdivide within those categories?",

We will talk about closing issues in a moment but even when issues are closed they are always accessible so all documentation within an issue can be used later and is well worth any energy investment you can make.\nThere is also not a time limit on issue comments so issues can remain open and active for as long as you find them useful.",

It is not always possible to predict how projects can evolve at the outset so you may find issues spanning multiple tasks despite your best efforts but as much as you can plan to keep a 1-to-1 ratio of tasks to issues you will find delegation and tracking of task completion that much easier.\nPersonally, I am a longtime believer in S.M.A.R.T. goals (i.e., goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-specific), but there are many established ways of partitioning a larger project to achievable sub-tasks and you should use whichever is most intuitive to you.\nIf issues seem like something that your group is broadly interested in it may be worthwhile to have a conversation about some general ‘rules of thumb’ for the scope of tasks identified by issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice - Create an Issue\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve covered what issues are and how to open them, let’s take a minute and create some issues on your repository! On your GitHub repository, click over to the Issues tab and create a new issue. This can be either a placeholder just to have experience creating an issue or a real task that you think the team will have to deal with in the future. We are here if you need clarification!",

However, next to the “[number] Open” button you can see a check mark with the number of closed issues.\n\n\n\nClicking that “Closed” button will access all past issues that are now closed.\n\n\n\nSo, even if an issue was closed in the distant past of your repository on GitHub, you can still easily access and view all of its contents.\nThis greatly facilitates the use of issues in tracking problem solving, brainstorm sessions, and supporting documents. The Scientific Computing Support team at NCEAS uses issues as personal lab notebooks (in addition to the aforementioned uses) to ensure that individual process is well documented while still being easily accessible by other team members.\nAs pointed out earlier though, issues are fundamentally optional to the use of GitHub and may not be needed by your team right now.

Currently there’s a README.md and only one script, test-script.R, in it.\n\n\n\ntest-script.R contains one line. Suppose we want to work on this script and add more lines to it.\n\n\n\nLet’s go commit our edits. The green lines highlight the fact that we’ve added two new lines to our script, lines 2 and 3. We type out our commit message, and click Commit.\n\n\n\nGreat! The message “Your branch is ahead of ‘origin/main’ by 1 commit” lets us know that everything is proceeding smoothly. Suppose that we decided to take a break and stepped away from our computer.\n\n\n\nThen, unbeknownst to us, our collaborator made their edits to the same script and committed and pushed their changes to the GitHub repository. At the moment, here is what the shared repository looks like.\n\n\n\nWhen we get back to our computer, we’re ready to push our changes to GitHub, but an error shows up. Basically, it is telling us that our GitHub repository contains changes that we do not have on our local computer. To remedy this, the message suggests that we pull the changes from GitHub to our machine to catch our local machine back up.\n\n\n\nAfter clicking Pull, we get a new error message: “Merge conflict in test-script.R”.\n\n\n\nLooking closer, the merge conflict prompted a new version of test-script.R to pop up. This version contains our edits and our collaborator’s edits, along with the delimiter lines that start with &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;. Git is urging us to manually fix the conflicted lines before continuing.\n\n\n\nOur file now has an U icon, which stands for an unresolved merge conflict.\n\n\n\nIn general terms the steps that come before a merge conflict are displayed in the visual below. Note that though this has visual similarity to the workflow diagrams throughout this bookdown we do not recommend intentionally causing a merge conflict :)",

Here is what the home screen looks like as of February 2022.\n\n\n\nLog in with your GitHub account that you should have created prior to this workshop.\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve logged in, you should see something like this:\n\n\n\nThis landing page has a nice summary of your recent repositories and activity on the left panel. Click on your icon at the top left corner and navigate to your profile.\n\n\n\nYour profile page shows the organizations that you’re a part of, as well as a more detailed view of your GitHub contributions/activities over time. There are also tabs at the top that lead you to your repositories, projects, packages, and starred repositories. If you would like, you can change your GitHub theme to dark mode by clicking on your icon at the top left corner and going to Settings then Appearances. For the purposes of this workshop, the rest of the screenshots for the GitHub website will be in dark mode to differentiate it from RStudio.\n\n\n\nIf there is anything else you would like to change about your account, the user settings page should have it.\n\nLooking at a GitHub Repository\nTo check the repositories that you’ve created, click on the Repositories tab. Note that the top left corner has a green button that will allow you to create new repositories. We will come back to that later. Let’s take a closer look at what the ucsb-ds-capstone-2021.github.io repository contains.\n\n\n\nThis screen shows the copy of a repository stored on GitHub, with its list of files, when the files and directories were last modified, and some information on who made the most recent changes.\n\n\n\nIf we look at the blue rectangle, we can see that there have been 151 commits made to this repository. By clicking on them, we can see the history of changes made to all of the files. Looks like 3 users were making changes in April.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, if we examine one of the changes made on April 25, we can see exactly what was changed in each file:\n\n\n\nThe red lines have been deleted while the green lines are new additions. Tracking these changes, and seeing how they relate to released versions of software and files is exactly what Git and GitHub are good for. We will show how they can really be effective for tracking versions of scientific code, figures, and manuscripts to accomplish a reproducible workflow.\nNote: it is possible to edit and add files entirely on the GitHub website, by navigating to the specific file or repository. However, for this workshop, we will be editing and adding files through RStudio instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Repository on GitHub\nTo stimulate a collaborative GitHub/RStudio workflow, we are going to have 1 person from each group create a new repository on their GitHub account. This will be the repository where everyone shares their files and code.\nTo create a new repository, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to your profile page and click on the Repositories tab.\nClick on New.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter a descriptive name for your new repository, here we named it git-practice (avoid upper case and use - or _ instead of spaces).\nWrite a 1-sentence description about the repository content.\nChoose Public (as of January 2019, GitHub now offers unlimited free private repositories with a maximum of 3 collaborators).\nCheck Add a README file.\n\n\n\n\nYay! We’ve just created a new repository! Here is what the landing page should look like:\n\n\n\nThis repository is currently public, so it’s visible to anyone, but since we are working in groups, we will need to give access to your group members. Click on the Settings tab for your repository and go to Collaborators.\n\n\n\nClick on Add people. Now let’s get the usernames of all of your group members and add them as collaborators to your repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat! Now everyone in the group should have access to the repository.",

As you can see from the Git pane of the above image (top right), after cloning our new repository, the only file Git is flagging as untracked is the .Rproj file created whenever you make a new RStudio project.\nIf we add *.Rproj to our .gitignore, the Git pane will show that the only change is that lines have been added to the .gitignore. The .Rproj file with the double yellow question marks next to it is gone!\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve edited the .gitignore it is generally a good practice to push those changes as soon as possible. If you flag a certain file (or folder) to be ignored while someone else is depending on it, if you wait to push the change you can risk a serious conflict.

    "text": "Our Recommendations\nThere are many different opinions on what should go into a .gitignore but we have a few suggestions that might prove helpful (or are at least worth considering).\n\nUse the GitHub .gitignore template for your chosen programming environment\n\nThere are a lot of small files that typical users don’t care about that your project will accumulate over its lifecycle. If you don’t flag these in the .gitignore it can become difficult to sort through your repository\n\nAdd .DS_Store\n\nMacs create a “Desktop Services Store” file (or “.DS_Store” for short) every time you open a folder. This file is invisible in your file manager but can be committed. This file has no practical value in your project and a separate one exists in every subfolder so tracking them can quickly clutter a repository if you use subfolders\n\nOther Considerations\n\nSome people recommend adding everything your script creates to the .gitignore. The theory being that if someone wants to see those outputs, they would only need to run your script(s) in order to create their own versions\nAnother way of thinking about this is to create a dedicated folder to store products in (e.g., “data”, “exports”, etc.) and then add that folder to the .gitignore. This means you don’t need to worry about adding specific files to the .gitignore so long as all the files live in a folder you’ve already designated as something for Git to not track\n\nDo you have another idea for what you typically add to a .gitignore?\n\nPlease share it with us by posting an Issue; we’d love to hear from you!\n\n\n\nShould You Ignore the .Rproj File?\nIf you are an RStudio user, you could choose to add the R project file to your .gitignore. However, this is a somewhat thorny decision with strong arguments on both sides. We’ll try to summarize some of the big considerations below to help inform your decision.\n\nOption A: Commit the .Rproj\nThere are (in our opinion) three strong arguments for committing the .Rproj:\n\nEase of Access\n\nFor non-R users, it can be really helpful to have just one file that they need to double click in order to open and interact with the whole R project. By committing the .Rproj, you make the post-clone start up instructions much simpler (i.e., “click the file ending in ‘.Rproj’ and you’re good to go”)\n\nFacilitate Cloning Outside of RStudio\n\nWhile our workshop has exclusively covered cloning a repo through RStudio, it is absolutely possible to clone without using RStudio. If someone goes this route, and the .Rproj is not already included in the repo, they will be left without one. So, after the clone they would then have an extra step to create their own .Rproj if they wanted to use RStudio to interact with the code\nNote that if everyone on your team is cloning via RStudio, this is not really an issue because cloning via RStudio creates a new .Rproj if one does not already exist\n\nEnforce Project Settings\n\nFundamentally, the .Rproj is a list of settings that you’re using for a specific project in RStudio. If you wanted to create some defaults of those settings for anyone who cloned your repository, you could commit your .Rproj with your preferred settings\nThat said, any member of your team who changed those settings would have the option to commit the corresponding change to the .Rproj file and the next time you pull you would have their settings instead\n\n\n\n\nOption B: Ignore the .Rproj\nWe feel there are some serious reasons for ignoring the .Rproj as well:\n\nRisk of Deletion\n\nSay you decide to commit your .Rproj, what happens if someone deletes it and pushes that deletion? This can happen if team members clone their version of the repo with a different name resulting in two local .Rproj files where one is redundant from that team member’s perspective\nIf a .Rproj is committed and then subsequently deleted, everyone who pulls that change will delete their local project. This results in an instant error that can be difficult to recognize if you don’t know beforehand about this risk. The only fix is for all affected users to re-clone the repository\nSo, if you add the .Rproj to the .gitignore preemptively, you can avoid the risk of this happening at some later stage; you could also add it as “*.Rproj” so regardless of the name of the file it will be ignored if the file type is .Rproj\n\nLoss of Flexibility\n\nWhen you commit your .Rproj you are “locking in” the name of your project. If your preliminary data exploration and analyses bring new hypotheses and goals to light you may want to change your project name to better match this new framing. If you had previously committed your .Rproj, it can be a hassle to change its name and push this change\nAlternatively, you may want to change your GitHub repository name after publication to share keywords with your final manuscript title or the journal name to make the repository more easily searchable by your readers. Technically you could change the GitHub repository name without changing the corresponding .Rproj filename but there will be some disonance there if your readers clone your code\n\nPreserve Team Members’ Local Filing Decisions\n\nMost working group members are involved in a staggering variety of pursuits in addition to their role in a synthesis working group. People tend to have their own filing systems in their computers to help them quickly and easily navigate among their different projects\nIf you commit the .Rproj, you force everyone who clones your repository to use your naming convention which can be a hurdle (albeit likely a minor one) as they juggle their responsibilities\n\n\n\n\nDecision\nUltimately, this is up to you and your team to decide! Hopefully our outlined reasons for and against adding the .Rproj to the .gitignore help inform this decision and we are happy to discuss this more if you have follow up questions!",

When working on your code you would iteratively edit and save the same code file and you would have a static folder (or folders) for data that you added to as you collected and entered or downloaded additional data.\nThere are variants of this where you may be archiving everything on your hard drive (e.g., Time Machine on Mac OS, etc.) and you may be using a “save as” feature to preserve some iterations of your code. You may also perform this same operation within a cloud-based storage system (e.g., Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) so that some versions of both code and data are preserved based on time stamps.\nThis approach has the advantage of relatively few moving parts but such editing of your code loses all previous versions that aren’t explicitly preserved (as well as a record of the changes).\nAnother limitation of this approach is that to work collaboratively, everything would need to be manually shared with your collaborator(s) which introduces a significant risk that someone in the research team would accidentally use the “wrong” version of either the code or the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nData Lifecycle Considerations\nThe above approach works when doing largely individual research, but what about at other stages in the typical lifecycle of data? Said lifecycle is displayed below where data is acquired via planning and collection, data are assessed and preserved, and finally, data are synthesized and used to inform future plans.\nIndividual workflows performed by a small research team can be well-served by the relatively bare-bones workflow illustrated above but such projects often emphasize data acquisition and preservation over synthesis and thus are not as limited by a need for real-time collaboration on coding scripts across a team. Individual projects certainly do data synthesis, they just by their nature have to emphasize data collection at least as much as the synthetic components of research.\nHowever, for larger teams–especially those that span disciplinary boundaries or have ongoing data collection protocols (e.g., research coordination networks, working groups, etc.)–the synthesis part of the data lifecycle often becomes progressively more important. This importance is tightly linked to a need for collaboration among team members on wrangling, analysis, and visualization scripts that in individual workflows can be managed by a single team member but cannot be in synthesis projects.\nCollaboration on coding can be accomplished by manually sharing code and data among group members but there are programs and websites that are specifically dedicated to meeting the need for collaboration. One example is “version control” systems (e.g., GitHub, SVN, etc.) that provide a framework for reproducible group work.\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesis Workflow\nVersion control systems preserve the iterative changes you and your team make to code and allow for informative titles and messages to be attached to these snapshots. This offers a clear advantage over ambiguous time-stamped versions preserved by cloud storage systems as it facilitates re-visiting code long after or by new team members who were not present for the initial writing. This approach is what we will be covering in greater depth in a few moments but the broad strokes are that you would preserve the history of your work and ensure that everyone uses the “right” version of the code.\nHowever, despite its advantages for collaborative coding, version control is not meant for preserving data so you would need to share data with your collaborators either via email or by storing data in the cloud and sharing links with team members. Depending upon how you implement either route for sharing data (email vs. cloud) your group is still at risk for group members using different versions of the data–especially if your group is involved in ongoing data collection.\nFurther, an inconvenience associated with this workflow is that each group member will store their copy of the data in a different network of nested folders on their local machine. This means that all references in the code to the path of the data (e.g., “home/users/me/project/data/…”) will differ, so running a collaboratively-developed piece of code would require careful specification to avoid getting a ‘this folder does not exist’ error. This is absolutely surmountable but can be a source of frustration over longer project timelines.\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesis Workflow on NCEAS’ Server\nFinally (for our purposes), you could build NCEAS’ server into your workflow to not only collaborate with colleagues on code but also centralize your data storage!\nThis method has all of the coding advantages of a workflow with version control (see above) in that it still facilitates reproducibility, transparency, and collaborative work. However, it also offers a secure location for all of your data to be stored that is accessible to all members on the same folder path.\nThis means that even though each group member could code separately in their own ‘home’ folder on the server (and send those changes back and forth with GitHub) all code could reference the same data location in the ‘shares’ folder on the server. This guarantees not only that all team members are using the same version of the data but that they are using the same exact data file.\nData can be moved from a specific computer onto the server by using any “File Transfer Protocol” (FTP) software (or “SSH FTP” a.k.a. SFTP). These programs function very much like the file manager on your computer (e.g., Finder on Mac) and allow simple dragging-and-dropping of files between your computer and the server. NCEAS has a tutorial on how to go about setting up an FTP or SFTP program on your computer that we are also happy to go over in greater depth as needed!\nAdding the server to your team’s workflow also allows you to work on code both on your folder in the server and on your personal computer as needed. This means that using the server for some of your coding needs does not mean that you are limited to solely using the server ad infinitum thereafter.\nAn ancillary benefit of this approach is the dramatic improvement in computational power when using the server (as compared to even a fast personal computer)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nWhile each approach offers its own strengths and weaknesses, in our experience many scientists avoid the latter two options due to knowledge barriers about how to get set up in these programs and websites, much less how to actually navigate those systems once set up!\nToday, we will strive to cover the fundamentals of using a version control system in your workflow (Option 2) and–for some groups, depending on interest–how to extend that workflow further and leverage NCEAS’ server to share data and work on code.\nPlease don’t hesitate to ask questions and remember that this link is a resource that you should feel free to refer back to if you ever need a refresher or wish to teach peers! There are supplementary appendices as well which we do not anticipate being able to get to today but we do think are likely to be valuable to you as your confidence with these systems grows.",

Once those changes are made you can stage changes within your local computer. After staging, it is best to retrieve the latest file versions from the cloud. You likely will already be up-to-date but this preemptive step can save you a lot of heartache down the line. Once you’ve confirmed that you have the latest file versions, you can shift the revised file(s) to the cloud where any GitHub users with access to your project can access the most recent file and look at the history of all previous changes.",

    "section": "Creating a New File",
    "text": "Creating a New File\nLet’s try out a simple Git workflow by first creating a new file. This is Step 1 of the process. We can add new R scripts and files to our repository through RStudio. Try creating a new script by going to File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. Feel free to type anything you want into this script as an example. Name this script after yourself. In the screenshot below, I have named my script angel-script.R.\nOnce you are done, navigate to the Git tab on the upper left corner. You should see your new script show up there along with a .gitignore and git-practice.Rproj file. Do not worry about the .gitignore file for now, it was created by RStudio to make sure that some temporary files are not tracked by Git. The git-practice.Rproj file will save your settings and open tabs when you close the project, and will restore these settings the next time you open it.\n\n\n\nNotice that there are color-coded icons next to the files in the “Git” tab. These icons are shorthand for the status–according to Git–of every* file in your working directory. Not technically “every” file because files that are tracked but haven’t been modified are not included. See below for definitions.\n\n\n\nIn our case, it means that our R script, .gitignore, and git-practice.Rproj files have never been tracked by Git (since these files were just created). Note also that the README.md file is not listed, but it exists (check the Files pane). It is because files that are tracked but have no modifications since the last commit are not listed.\n\nAdding our Script to the Next Commit\nLet us look at the diff of our script. Click on the Diff tab.\n\n\n\nChecking our script, we can see the new lines that we just typed are in green, which indicates that these lines have been added for Git. We would like to save a snapshot of this version of our script. Since we’ve just done Step 1, here are the rest of the steps we will need to do to get our script to show up on our GitHub repository:\nStep 2: Add the file to the next commit by checking the box in front of the file name. Note that the two ? icons will change to a single A on the left to show you that this file is now staged to be part of the next commit.\nStep 3: In the right pane, type a short but descriptive commit message detailing what you have done so far. Then click on the Commit button to save this version of the script in the Git database.\n\n\n\nIf all of the above steps went well, you should see something like this:\n\n\n\nNotice that Git tells us that 1 file changed because we’ve just added a new file to our commit. Now close the window. Before sending our changes back to GitHub, we should make sure that the copy of the repository on RStudio is completely up-to-date with the one on GitHub to avoid any conflicts.\n\n\nGetting the Latest Updates\nThere are two Git commands to exchange between a local and remote versions of a repository:\n\nPull: Git will get the latest remote version and try to merge it with your local version\nPush: Git will send your local version to the remote version of the repository (in our case GitHub)\n\nBefore sending your local version to the remote, you should always get the latest remote version first. In other words, you should pull first and push second. This is the way Git protects the remote version against incompatibilities with the local version. You always deal with potential problems on your local machine. Therefore your sequence will always be:\n\nCommit\nPull\nPush\n\nOf course RStudio has icons for that on top of the “Git” tab, with the blue arrow down being for pull and the green arrow up being for push. Remember the icons are organized in sequence!\nLet us do the pull and push to synchronized the remote repositories. Click on the Pull button to pull changes (if any) from the GitHub repository to the copy on RStudio. We have now synchronized the local (our computer) and remote (on GitHub) versions of our repository. You may have noticed that all of our preceding graphics use blue for pull-related content and green for push-related information. Hopefully that helps cement the two ideas in your mind!\n\n\n\nIn my case, it turns out that a new script, lyon-script, was added to the GitHub repository by a collaborator while I was making my own script. Since I have just pulled, lyon-script now shows up in my RStudio files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new message has popped up for me: “Your branch is ahead of ‘origin/main’ by two commits”. This means that I have two additional commits on my local machine that I never shared back to the remote repository on GitHub. If I look at the content of my repository on GitHub, I will see just the README.md and lyon-script. My changes are NOT in the cloud yet. You might be seeing a similar message as well.\n\n\nSending Changes back to GitHub\nSo how do we send our changes back to GitHub? Locate the Push button on the “Git” tab and click on it. Now your script should show up in the GitHub repository!\n\n\n\nOnce you click that button you should get a success screen like the one pictured below.\n\n\n\nNavigate back to the GitHub website and find your repository. Check to see if your script has been added correctly. In my case, angel-script.R finally shows up in my repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf RStudio ever asks for a “password”…\n\n\n\nIf your personal access token (PAT) was not set up correctly with RStudio or if it expired, then RStudio will ask for your GitHub username and password in a pop-up when you try to push. Please be aware that when they ask for a “password”, they actually meant your token! Enter your token in the field and you should be able to push now. Make sure to run gitcreds::gitcreds_set() to set a valid token afterwards so you don’t have to enter it manually every time!\n\n\n\n\nRinse and Repeat\nGreat! Now that your script has been added to the group repository, you should try to repeat the same workflow over again just to get a feel for how it works. Go back to RStudio and edit your own script. Save those edits, add your edited file to the staging area, write a commit message, then commit your changes. After committing, make sure to pull first then push after! When you pull, you might notice that scripts from your group members/collaborators will show up in your RStudio files.\nMake sure to work on your own script. If you and another group member work on the same script at the same time, this may lead to merge conflicts with Git. If two people were to work on the same script, they may be making different edits on the same lines, and Git would not know which edits to keep. To avoid merge conflicts, be mindful of what files you are working on and always communicate this to your group members!",

Picking a view option is essentially only a user interface change, not a fundamental change to how tasks are managed by or added to a given project (more on that later!).\n\nBoard View\nThe first view option (and in our opinion the best for working groups) is the “board” option. In this view, issues are tracked in vertical columns and can be dragged among columns at will. Columns are often used to denote issue status such that columns further to the right are closer to finished. Column names, colors, and description text can all be edited to fit your team’s needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable View\nThe second view option is the ‘table’ option.

    "text": "Getting Started on the Server\n\nNecessary Software\nThe only software that you will need on your personal computer to get set up on NCEAS’ server is RStudio!\nYou likely have worked in the “Console” tab of RStudio (where run lines and outputs appear; see below) but RStudio has another tab to the right of the “Console” called “Terminal” which offers RStudio users access to the command line (a.k.a. the shell). If you are a veteran command line user you may prefer to use the standalone Terminal app on MacOS or PuTTY on Windows but for the sake of keeping your tool kit streamlined, we’ll walk through getting set up on NCEAS’ server using only RStudio’s Terminal tab.\n\n\n\nThe Terminal does not accept R syntax (and the Console doesn’t accept Terminal syntax) so you may notice that some of the code we’ll walk you through below is formatted differently than you would write an R script.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Invited!\nIn order to access the server (and follow the instructions below) we’ll need to create an account on the server for you. Please email someone on our team or scicomp@nceas.ucsb.edu so that we can contact NCEAS’ IT team and get an invite email sent to you.\nIn that email, please include the name and email addresses of all of your team members who want to access the server. After that information has been received, NCEAS’ IT team will create accounts for all of those people and will send you an invitation email to set up your account on the server.\nAn example of what that email may look like is included below but there are two key pieces of information:\n\nYour username\nYour temporary password (covered by a red bar in the screenshot).\n\nIf you have not received that email, check your Spam folder for emails from Thomas Hetmank (hetmank@nceas.ucsb.edu) or Nick Outin (outin@nceas.ucsb.edu). If you have not received the email and it is not in your Spam, reach out to our team and we will work to get an invite sent to you.\n\n\n\n\n\nSigning into the Server\nIn the following instructions, all words that look like this should be typed into the Terminal tab and run by pressing return or enter. Note that typing these commands into an R script or R Markdown will not work because it will attempt to run in the Console. All words that look [like this] (i.e., bracketed) should also be typed into the Terminal tab but the specific text should be replaced in a user-specific way that is clarified in the nearby text.\n\nIn the Terminal pane of RStudio, you will “ssh” into the server by running the following code: ssh [your username]@aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu. It is @aurora because the name of the server is Aurora.\nIf this is the first time you’ve accessed the server you will need to enter yes to accept the server’s SSH key.\nYou will then be prompted to enter your [temporary password] (see the above email example). Note that the cursor will not advance as you type but it is registering your entries! There will be no indication that you are typing (such as: “•••••••••”) This throws off many users so hopefully the above note helps set your mind at ease.\nYou will then be prompted to change your “expired” password. We consider your temporary password to be expired as soon as you use it because sharing passwords via email is not secure and this “expiration” lets you set the password to something that only you know at the outset of your time in the server. Note again that the cursor will not advance as you type but it is working! To update your password, enter your [temporary password], then [your strong new password] and finally re-type [your strong new password] to confirm it. Note that your new password should not be “your strong new password” :)\nYou are ready to go! Run exit to log out of the server in the Terminal tab.\nNow that you have set a new password, use your favorite web browser (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, etc.) to access Aurora and click “Login to RStudio Server”\nIn the resulting page, you can sign in with the same username and password you just signed in on the Terminal tab with.\nYou should now be in something that looks very much like RStudio but is housed in a tab on your browser! We will work together from here on out so once you have reached this point, let our team know and we can gather the group before continuing.\n\nIf the above steps have not resulted in successfully accessing Aurora, consult NCEAS’ instructions on first login and/or SSH-specific instructions for Mac vs. Windows and/or email us!\n\n\nConnecting GitHub and the Server\nYour server “self” is essentially a different computer that you access via a browser (or command line in some cases). Because of this, you will need to tell GitHub that your server self is allowed to access your GitHub self’s content. To do this you’ll need to authenticate via personal access token or SSH key pair. Revisit our authentication instructions in the “Workshop Preparation” section of the workshop home page for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer + PAT Note\n\n\n\nIf you choose token-based authentication you’ll also need to tell the server to store your token for some amount of time otherwise the server will “forget” it between sessions.\nIn the Terminal pane of the server’s RStudio session run the following code:\n\ngit config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'\n\nThis tells your server self to remember your token for 10 million minutes (roughly 20 years).\n\n\n\n\nOptional Other Steps\nYou may want to configure additional settings, such as:\n\nThe default branch name (for new repositories)\n\n\nusethis::git_default_branch_configure(name = \"main\")",

    "text": "Working on the Server\nOnce you’re properly set up, working on the server should be completely seamless! Instead of opening RStudio on your computer you’ll open a browser and work on the server from there but otherwise the feeling and process of version control should be identical. Eventually you may even want to make commits on your computer, push them to GitHub (after pulling!), then pull those same commits down to your server self and continue working there.\nYou’ll find working on the server to be dramatically faster for computationally-intense operations so we hope this guide has been helpful in getting you prepared to take advantage of that benefit!",

    "section": "Uploading Data to the Server",
    "text": "Uploading Data to the Server\n\nVia RStudio\nIf you are uploading a single file, it may be most convenient to use RStudio’s data upload capabilities. In the “Files” pane (default is top right but it may differ on your computer), you can click the button that is a white rectangle with a yellow circle with an upward facing arrow inside of it. In the below image the relevant button is in a red square.\n\n\n\nClicking that button allows you to choose (1) where you want the uploaded file to go and (2) which file you want to upload.\n\n\n\nYou can also download data via the RStudio interface. To download a file, check the box next to it in the “Files” pane.\n\n\n\nOnce the box is checked, click the gear icon then click the “Export…” option (about halfway down). In the image below this option is surrounded by a red square\n\n\n\nIn the resulting box you can choose to rename the file before downloading to your local computer. After renaming the file (or keeping its original name), click the “Download” button and the download should begin after a moment.\n\n\n\nThese methods are effective for one or a few files being up/downloaded to the same directory but can quickly become cumbersome if you want to handle many files or a few files to several different folders.\n\n\nVia sFTP Software\nIf you want to upload or download many files we recommend using sFTP software (secure File Transfer Protocol). We use Cyberduck internally, though there are alternatives like WinSCP. Both programs are free to use and more than capable of uploading and download many files to/from the server quickly and easily.\nOnce you have installed one of these programs, you can sign in to the server from the sFTP program using your server username and password and can then upload or download files from your personal computer in the same way as you would move files among folders within your personal computer.\n\nCyberduck Set Up Tutorial\nHere we briefly demonstrate how to set up a connection between Cyberduck and NCEAS’ Server. Note that you must have already installed Cyberduck to follow these steps.\n\nIn the Cyberduck window, click the “Open Connection” button with an icon of a globe with a plus sign. In the below image the button has a red square around it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the resulting window, input the following information:\n\n“Server” – “aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu”\n“Username” – whatever your username on the server is\n“Password” – your password to the server\n“Port” – change it to “22” (it will start as “21”)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, click the dropdown menu at the top that says “FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and select”SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)” from the set of available options.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve input the above information, click the “Connect” button and you should have access to the server! You can now click around the different folders you have access to and upload or download from there.\n\n\nTo download: click the files/folders that you want and they should begin downloading to your personal computer\nTo upload: drag and drop the files where you want them\n\n\n\n\nVia the Command Line\nIf you are more comfortable with a CLI (Command Line Interface) you can also use that method of uploading/downloading. The command line includes the Terminal pane in RStudio, Terminal app for Macs, PuTTY, and gitBash among others. CLI can be a great tool to leverage filenames or types to filter specific files you would like to upload / download. Text in code chunks below are command line commands and any bracketed text [like this] should be replaced by some user-specific information before running.\nThis portion of the tutorial is focused on using the command line to interact with the server. That said, if you’re interested in the command line more generally or for other purposes, please reach out to our team!\n\nCLI Option A: scp\nThe scp command can be used to upload a file or folder from your computer to the server.\n1A. Navigate to the folder on your computer containing the file(s) you want to upload\n\ncd [folder]\n\n\nNote that if the folder name has spaces you’ll need to “escape” the space by using a backslash (\\)\n\n\ncd [folder\\ name]\n\n2A. Now you can upload that file to the server!\n\nscp [file_name] [user]@aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu:/[path/to/destination_folder/]\n\nIf instead you’d like to upload all of the files in a folder, do the following:\n1B. Navigate to the folder containing the folder on your computer you want to upload (using cd)\n\ncd [folder]\n\n2B. Use scp with the recursive option (-r) to upload all of the files in that folder\n\nscp -r [folder] [user]@aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu:/[path/to/destination_folder/]\n\n\nNote that this uploads all of the files in the folder not the folder itself so you may want to create a new folder on the server to upload your local folder’s contents into.\n\nFinally, note that you can also download files from the server to your local machine by simply switching the order of the machines:\n\nscp [user]@aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu:/[path/to/server_folder/file_name] [local_folder] \n\n\n\nCLI Option B: sftp\nThe get command can be used to download a file.\n\nConnect to the server\n\n\nsftp [user]@aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu:/home/shares\n\nYour prompt at the shell should now have switched to sftp&gt; and although it is the same window you are now looking at the files on the server! Try it by typing the ls command at the prompts. This will list all the files and folders within the shares folder on Aurora.\n\nEnter your group’s folder in the shares folder\n\n\ncd [your_group_folder]\n\n\nIf needed, continue using cd to get to the subfolder you want to access. Remember to “escape” any spaces in the folder name with backslashes!\n\n\ncd [subfolder]\n\nNote that most of the bash command will work, so you can use ls to list files and pwd to check your current path.\n\nWhen you are in the folder containing the file(s) you want, download the file you want\n\n\nget [file_name_server]\n\n\nYou can also upload a local file to the server by using the put sFTP command\n\n\nput [file_name_local]\n\n\nWhen you are done downloading, close the connection to the server\n\n\nexit",
