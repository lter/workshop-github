## Development Version

This reflects the current state of the repository. Changes from the preceding version/GitHub release are listed here as they are made.

- Streamlined / clarified workshop preparation steps

## Version 1.2

Features include:

- Added alt text to all images in every section of the workshop
- Standardized image embedding syntax to be exclusively HTML
    - Previously was markdown syntax for images that were 100% width and HTML for others
- Fixed some minor typos in the plain text

## Version 1.1

Features include:

- Expanded 'server' module to demonstrate several modes of uploading data to a server (including useful screenshots for key steps)

## Version 1.0

This is the first functioning version of the workshop in this GitHub Organization. Previously the workshop was hosted in [this Github repository](https://github.com/NCEAS/scicomp-workshop-collaborative-coding) but we've chosen to migrate it here from now on.

Features include:

- All content from the workshop's prior location
- Consistent alt text for images in workshop home page
    - Priority for next release is adding alt text to _all_ images throughout workshop
