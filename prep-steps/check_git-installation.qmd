Regardless of your operating system, once you've installed Git, check that worked with the following {{< fa terminal >}} command line code. All operating systems should be able to run this in the "Terminal" pane of RStudio.

```
# Run me in RStudio's "Terminal"
which git
```

RStudio should be able to detect Git so let's check from that side too. In RStudio click through the following menus: "Tools" {{< fa arrow-right >}} "Global Options" {{< fa arrow-right >}} "Git / SVN" (cardboard box icon in left sidebar). **If you see a file path under "Git executable" then you are good to go!**

#### Git Not Detected?

If you had your RStudio session open while you installed Git for the first time, RStudio may not have detected Git on your computer. In that case, please close and restart RStudio before checking again.
